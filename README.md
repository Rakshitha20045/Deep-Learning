Stock Price Prediction :
     Dataset details : 
                       
                       Open → price when the market opens that day (first trade of the day).
     
                       High → highest price reached during the day.
                       
                       Low → lowest price during the day.
                       
                       Close → price when the market closes.
                       
                       Volume → total number of shares traded that day.
